# Session Webhook Server

This project provides a webhook server for `session.js`. It serves two primary functions:

1. **Exposes Webhook Endpoints**: It allows you to control a Session client via a simple REST API to perform actions like sending messages, attachments, and managing profile details.
2. **Forwards Session Events**: It listens to all events from the Session client (like incoming messages, reactions, etc.) and forwards them to a pre-configured external webhook URL.

This makes it easy to integrate Session messaging capabilities into other applications, such as automation platforms (n8n, Zapier), custom bots, or backend services.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Control Session actions with simple HTTP requests.
- **Event Forwarding**: Get real-time notifications for all Session activity.
- **Secure**: Protect your API endpoints with an API key.
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses a file-based storage system to maintain the Session identity across restarts.
- **Easy to Deploy**: Run it locally with `bun` or as a Docker container.

## Prerequisites

- **Bun**: For local installation. [Installation guide](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For containerized deployment.

## Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd bot-webhook
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3. **Configure your environment:**
    Copy the example environment file and edit it with your own values.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for details on each variable. **You must provide a `SESSION_MNEMONIC`**.

4. **Run the server:**
    - For production:

      ```bash
      bun start
      ```

    - For development (with auto-reloading):

      ```bash
      bun run dev
      ```

The server will be running on the port specified in your `.env` file (default: `8080`).

## Docker Deployment

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd bot-webhook
    ```

2. **Configure your environment:**
    Create a `.env` file from the example. The `docker-compose.yml` file will automatically load it.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Fill in the variables, especially `SESSION_MNEMONIC` and `API_KEY`.

3. **Build and run with Docker Compose:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

4. **Check the status and logs:**

    ```bash
    # Check container status
    docker-compose ps

    # View logs in real-time
    docker-compose logs -f session-webhook
    ```

5. **To stop the server:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

    The `session-data` volume will persist your session storage, so you won't lose your identity.

## Configuration

The server is configured using environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory to set them.

| Variable               | Description                                                                 | Default Value                  | Required |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| `PORT`                 | The port on which the server will listen.                                   | `8080`                         | No       |
| `API_KEY`              | A secret key to authorize API requests.                                     | `your-secure-api-key-here`     | Yes      |
| `WEBHOOK_URL`          | The external URL to which Session events will be forwarded.                 | `https://example.com/signal`   | Yes      |

| `SESSION_DISPLAY_NAME` | The display name for the Session bot.                                       | `Session Webhook Bot`          | No       |
| `STORAGE_FILE`         | Path to the file for persistent session storage.                            | `./session-storage.db`         | No       |
| `LOG_LEVEL`            | The logging level (`error`, `warn`, `info`, `http`, `verbose`, `debug`).    | `info`                         | No       |

## Forwarded Events Reference

The server listens for events from the Session client and forwards them as `POST` requests to the `WEBHOOK_URL` defined in your configuration.

### Event Structure

All forwarded events have the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "event": "eventName",
  "payload": {
    // Payload content depends on the event type
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Event Types

The following events are forwarded. The `payload` content is determined by the `@session.js/client` library.

| Event Name                 | Description                                                              |
